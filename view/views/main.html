            <h3>Omni-Channel Architecture</h3>
            <p>Omnichannel is a still new and the idea is still developing. Omnichannel is about true continuity of your experience. But the key is that it extends beyond a single brandâ€™s universe. Being omniscient is perceiving and understanding all things. And the best way for a customer to perceive everything is to allow them to own their data and experience, then give them the ability to use it to guide creation and context of every future experience.</p>

            <h3>Components</h3>

            <p>Component is the smallest deployment unit in the framework and it contains Web Component built with AngularJS, configurations data in database, a set of rules built in Java. Components are separate with data so that it can be open sourced and reused anywhere and it can only be alive as part of the view which can have several components and other contents. Angular schema form is one of the components.</p>

            <h3>Views</h3>

            <p>Views are also called pages and it consists several components and static contents. It is working independently with other views except sharing data and routing to other views.

            <p>An application contains several views linked by routing rules and it provides user experience on certain function on a site. It can be deployed separately and manages views dependencies and versions. One web site can have several applications to hundreds of applications. Blog, Forum and News are common applications already implemented in the framework; however, users can choose to other ui experience. </p>
